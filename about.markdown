Hello friends, my name is Moritz. I am a software engineer in Germany working in embedded software development.
In my free time am also interested in data science and AI.
On this site I share some projects and articles related to my interests and about whatever goes through my head.
If you have any questions or suggestions please do not hesitate to reach out to me.

You can find the source code of my projects at GitHub:
